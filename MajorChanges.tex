\section*{Changes at a Glance}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The class \classfile combines the old classes \textit{ees-book}, \textit{ees-report}, \textit{ees-protocol} and \textit{ees-article}. For letters, presentations and posters the old versions must be used (see archive).
	\item Only the engine {\LuaLaTeX} can be used. In particular, {\LuaLaTeX} offers advantages over the older engine {pdf\LaTeX} when it comes to the outsourcing of images (\texttt{externalize=true}) and the choice of the font (\texttt{fontfamiliy=}).
	\item Extensive revision of the class definition (packages, standardisation, etc.) carried out. Compatibility with existing \texttt{.tex} files of the old classes is not necessarily given.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Preliminary Note}
\begin{itemize}
	\item If problems occur when compiling with the new class, this could have the following reasons and solutions
	\begin{itemize}
		\item MiKTeX distribution outdated \\ \quad $\rightarrow$ Update packages 
		\item Processor settings not set correctly (e.g. pdflatex vs. lualatex) \\ \quad $\rightarrow$ Check settings
		\item $\rightarrow$ Alternatively, uninstall the distribution and editor, delete old temporary files, reinstall. (It makes sense to make a backup of user settings such as the output profiles in \gls*{gls:txc} in advance).
